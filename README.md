# Privacy Community Group Meetings

This repository contains agendas, minutes, and other materials from meetings of the [Privacy CG](https://privacycg.github.io/).

We have three kinds of meetings:

1. **Face-to-faces** ([logistics, agendas, and minutes for 2020](2020/))
    We hope to have a couple of face-to-face meetings each year.
2. **Plenary teleconferences** ([logistics, agendas, and minutes for 2020](2020/telcons/))
    We meet in plenary twice a month.
3. **Ad-hoc teleconferences**
    We occasionally have ad-hoc calls on specific topics.

    The scheduling and logistics of such calls may vary depending on the topic and expected attendees. Agendas and minutes for such meetings are posted in the same place as our regularly-scheduled plenary calls.

    If you would like us to have an ad-hoc call on some topic of interest to you, please [file an issue in this repo](https://github.com/privacycg/meetings/issues/new) requesting one.
