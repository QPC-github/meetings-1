# Privacy Community Group Meetings in 2021

We have not yet scheduled any face-to-face meetings in 2021.

We have one face-to-face meeting scheduled:

* [May 2021 Virtual F2F](05-virtual)

And we anticipate having one or two other F2Fs later in the year.

We have regular [teleconferences](telcons/) throughout the year.
