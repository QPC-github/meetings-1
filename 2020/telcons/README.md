# Privacy Community Group Teleconferences in 2020

The Privacy CG meets on the **2nd and 4th Thursdays** of each month, at
noon Boston time (EST). That translates to

| Time  | Day | Location |

We use the same infrastructure as [PING](https://www.w3.org/Privacy/IG/)
does for its calls. See PINGâ€™s [meeting information](https://www.w3.org/Privacy/IG/#meeting-information)
for the dial-in details.

We use [this Cryptpad](https://cryptpad.w3ctag.org/code/#/2/code/edit/ZrkcuhmVbx1OGyWlTX5L0j8T/) for taking minutes.
