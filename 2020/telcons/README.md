# Privacy Community Group Teleconferences in 2020

The Privacy CG meets on the 2nd and 4th Thursdays of each month, at noon
Boston time (EST). That translates to

* 2:00 AM Friday in Tokyo
* 4:00 AM Friday in Sydney
* 9:00 AM Thursday in San Francisco
* 12:00 PM Thursday in Boston
* 5:00 PM Thursday in London
* 6:00 PM Thursday in Brussels

We use the same infrastructure as [PING](https://www.w3.org/Privacy/IG/)
does for its calls. See PINGâ€™s [meeting information](https://www.w3.org/Privacy/IG/#meeting-information)
for the dial-in details.

We use [this Cryptpad](https://cryptpad.w3ctag.org/code/#/2/code/edit/ZrkcuhmVbx1OGyWlTX5L0j8T/) for taking minutes.
