# Privacy Community Group Teleconferences in 2020

The Privacy CG meets on the 2nd and 4th Thursdays of each month, at noon
Boston time (EST). That translates to

We use the same infrastructure as [PING](https://www.w3.org/Privacy/IG/)
does for its calls. See PINGâ€™s [meeting information](https://www.w3.org/Privacy/IG/#meeting-information)
for the dial-in details.

We use [this Cryptpad](https://cryptpad.w3ctag.org/code/#/2/code/edit/ZrkcuhmVbx1OGyWlTX5L0j8T/) for taking minutes.
