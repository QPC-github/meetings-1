## Logistics

We will use the `#privacycg` channel in [PING's slack](https://w3cping.slack.com/) as an informal chat room during the meeting.  Please try to use slack rather than the zoom chat.  If you don't have access to the slack instance, please contact Sam Weiler or one of the chairs for access.

We'll use our regular **[Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DZEhS1UHJ1PKxt5ZwKmn5LZ4bo10UFyNXeLp2dUuzRM/edit#) for taking minutes**, and we'll use **these Zoom meeting details**:
